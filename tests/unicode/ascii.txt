ASCII (ASS-kee)[3], an acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. ASCII has just 128 code points, of which only 95 are printable characters, which severely limit its scope. The set of available punctuation had significant impact on the syntax of computer languages and text markup. ASCII hugely influenced the design of character sets used by modern computers, including Unicode which has over a million code points, but the first 128 of these are the same as ASCII.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding.[2]

ASCII is one of the IEEE milestones.[4]

Overview

ASCII was developed in part from telegraph code. Its first commercial use was in the Teletype Model 33 and the Teletype Model 35 as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services.[when?] Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963,[5][6] underwent a major revision during 1967,[7][8] and experienced its most recent update during 1986.[9] Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters.[9]

The use of ASCII format for Network Interchange was described in 1969.[10] That document was formally elevated to an Internet Standard in 2015.[11]

Originally based on the (modern) English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart in this article.[12] Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, and punctuation symbols. In addition, the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing control codes which originated with Teletype models; most of these are now obsolete,[13] although a few are still commonly used, such as the carriage return, line feed, and tab codes.

For example, lowercase i would be represented in the ASCII encoding by binary 1101001 = hexadecimal 69 (i is the ninth letter) = decimal 105.

Despite being an American standard, ASCII does not have a code point for the cent. It also does not support English terms with diacritical marks such as resume and jalapeno, or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as Beyonce (although on certain devices characters could be combined with punctuation such as Tilde (~) and Backtick (`) to approximate such characters.)

History

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now INCITS). The ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI)[3]: 211  and ultimately became the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963,[6][14] leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.[3]: 66, 245  There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.[3]: 435  The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks[a][15] 6 and 7,[16] and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.[17] The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.[18] Locating the lowercase letters in sticks[a][15] 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the brace and vertical bar characters),[19] renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).[3]: 247–248  ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967,[7][20] then USAS X3.4-1968,[21] ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.[9][22]
