Hello, RSVIM!
This is a quite simple and small test lines.
But still it contains several things we want to test:
	1. When the line is small enough to completely put inside a row of the window content widget, then the line-wrap and word-wrap doesn't affect the rendering.
	2. When the line is too long to be completely put in a row of the window content widget, there're still multiple cases.
